# Isaac3D

I love Binding of Isaac, especially for the fact that the gameplay is very simple, but all the games are unique.

I was intrigued by the conception of such a video game, especially for the bonus items part which creates a certain modularity to the game, as most part of the bonus items are combinable between each others.

That is why I decided to create a 3D prototype of this game.

This project is still on progress,  I think I already have created the most important bricks of the game architecture : 

* Random level generation
* Bonus items mechanics 
* Ennemies mechanics

Now I have to script ennemies, bonus items, bosses, and I also have to model more 3D models of the game (Ennemies, bosses, rooms...)
